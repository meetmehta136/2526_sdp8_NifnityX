- **Planning & Charts:** I spent some time planning the "NifnityX" dashboard layout to figure out the main pages we need, like the Strategy Tuner, Trade History, and Broker Keys. I also found that the TradingView widget doesn't support Nifty 50 for free, so I had to start researching other trading chart widgets.

- **The Charts:** I spent some time figuring out the best way to show stock data. Instead of building a graph from scratch (which is complex), I found out I can just embed the **TradingView widget**. It’s way smoother and gives us live Nifty 50 data for free.

- **Learning NLP:** I watched a bunch of NLP tutorials on YouTube to figure out how to process the market data.
