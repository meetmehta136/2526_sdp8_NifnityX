- **Planning & Charts:** I spent this lab planning the app layout, like where to securely put the API keys and a small status light to check if the bot is running. I also realized the TradingView widget won't work for Nifty 50, so I had to start looking for other chart options. On top of that, I designed the controls for changing the Renko size and switching to paper trading.

- **The Charts:** I spent some time figuring out the best way to show stock data. Instead of building a graph from scratch (which is complex), I found out I can just embed the **TradingView widget**. It’s way smoother and gives us live Nifty 50 data for free.

- **Learning NLP:** I watched a bunch of NLP tutorials on YouTube to figure out how to process the market data.
